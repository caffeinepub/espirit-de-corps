  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-11, REQ-12, REQ-13) appear to be implemented in the ContactCTA.tsx component. The file-summaries.txt explicitly confirms the updated email (saravana@espiritdecrops.com), phone (+91 7259145275 with tel: link), and location (Bangalore – All India Remote Available). No hallucinated features are evident — the diff only modifies the ContactCTA component's contact details without altering layout, styling, or form logic.",
